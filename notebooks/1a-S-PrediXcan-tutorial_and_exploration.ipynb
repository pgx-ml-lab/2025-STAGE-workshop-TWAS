    "# Workshop on Statistical Genetics and Genetic Epidemiology STAGE-Quebec\n",
    "## Theme 2 - Molecular Phenotypes in Genetic Epidemiology\n",
    "\n",
    "By Marc-André Legault (Université de Montréal) and Qihuang Zhang (McGill University)\n",
    "\n",
    "**July 31 - August 1, 2025**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop provides a comprehensive introduction to transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). We will demonstrate how to identify type 2 diabetes (T2D) genes by testing the association between predicted gene expression across various tissues and T2D risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis employs real-world data from a large-scale meta-analysis involving 180,834 T2D cases and over one million controls from [Mahajan _et al._ (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01058-3). These are high-quality summary statistics that represent current standards in genetic epidemiology research.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will cover two established TWAS approaches:\n",
    "- **[S-PrediXcan](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03621-1)**\n",
    "- **[TWAS FUSION](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3506)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The GWAS summary statistics have been harmonized to match the genome build (GRCh38) used by the gene expression prediction models. We have curated a focused set of tissues from GTEx to balance comprehensiveness with computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workshop Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop is organized into three interconnected sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **S-PrediXcan** (this Notebook) - Fundamentals of summary statistics-based TWAS using S-PrediXcan.\n",
    "2. **TWAS / FUSION** [(link)](2a-FUSION.ipynb) - A second software to conduct TWAS.\n",
    "3. **Comparing Methods** [(link)](3a-compare_TWAS_models.ipynb) - Comparative analysis of the results.\n",

    "**Navigation:** Use the file browser in the left pane to explore all workshop materials and switch between notebooks.\n",

    "### Exploring the GWAS Summary Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running S-PrediXcan, we will examine our input data. Understanding the structure and content of GWAS summary statistics is essential for any TWAS analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our GWAS summary statistics have been harmonized with [PredictDB](https://predictdb.hakyimlab.org/) models—the standard gene expression prediction models that accompany S-PrediXcan. This harmonization ensures that variant names, allele coding, and genomic coordinates are aligned between our GWAS data and the prediction models.\n",

    "Each input parameter serves a specific purpose:\n",

    "- **`gwas_file`**: Our harmonized GWAS summary statistics\n",
